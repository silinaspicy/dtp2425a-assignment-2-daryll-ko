"Never Gonna Git You Up"

We're all strangers to love
You know the tools and so do I (do I)
A full (commit)ment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't Git this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm forking
Gitta make you understand

Never gonna Git you up
Never gonna let you frown
Never gonna not expound and desert you
Never gonna make you sigh
Never gonna even try
Never gonna push to main and hurt you

We've cloned each other for so long
Your code's been failing, but you're too shy to say it (say it)
Inside, we don't know what's been going on (going on)
We know it's lame but we're gonna say it
And if you ask me what I'm seeing
Don't tell me you're still using C

Never gonna Git you up
Never gonna let you frown
Never gonna not expound and desert you
Never gonna make you sigh
Never gonna even try
Never gonna push to main and hurt you
