"Always Gonna Rizz You Up"

We're no betas to love
You got the rizz and so do I (do I)
Go to ohio's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other gyatt

I just wanna tell you how I'm mewing
Gyatta make you understand

Always gonna rizz you up
Always gonna mog them down
Never gonna cap around and downvote you
Fanum taxing food with Kai
All my fellas in Ohio
Always gonna be sigma and skibidi

We've rizzed each other for so long
Your mews been failing, but you're beta to say it (say it)
Inside, we don't know who's the sussy one (sussy one)
We know it's cringe but we're gonna say it
And if you ask me how I'm mewing
Don't tell me you're ishowspeed

Always gonna rizz you up
Always gonna mog them down
Never gonna cap around and downvote you
Fanum taxing food with Kai
All my fellas in Ohio
Always gonna be sigma and skibidi
